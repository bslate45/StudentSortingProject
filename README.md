# Student Sorting Project

This project was made to demonstrate Java design and programming abilities. I was compelled to do this project after being presented it through an interview process. What it does is generates random first and last names to populated a file of students. The number of students is given by the user through Java's STDIN, it will then sort the last names alphabetically if the last names are the same then the program will sort the first names. It utilizes both file reads and writes to generated two files, an unsorted list of names and a sorted list of names. This program utilizes Object-Oriented design to be able to expand functionality if I decide to add components.
